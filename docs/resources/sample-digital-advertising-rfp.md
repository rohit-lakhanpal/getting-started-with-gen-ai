Event# 4497 FicticiousPD Digital Advertising Campaign for Recruiting Officers
Annual Contract

2.0 Broad Description of Project
The purpose of these specifications is to receive proposals from qualified contractors for services for a digital media campaign aimed at recruiting qualified police officer applicants for the Ficticia-Chatham Metropolitan Police Department (FicticiousPD). Electronic submissions will not be accepted.

- The FicticiousPD and the City of Ficticia are undergoing an extensive recruitment campaign effort for the next couple of years. Due to the FicticiousPD’s high standards for hiring, generally 10-12% of the applicants who apply successfully pass testing and evaluations.
- The recruiting campaign will focus on southeast Ficticia and the surrounding region, with emphasis on recruitment from the Ficticia Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA), as well as nearby counties.
- The FicticiousPD desires to hire both males and females of all races, with preference given to applicants with a college degree and/or prior law enforcement experience.
- More than 90% of applicants research jobs online as opposed to attending career fairs or searching through newspapers or trade magazines. Previous digital media advertising efforts have had a direct impact on the number of visits to the FicticiousPD website’s “Join FicticiousPD” recruiting page and the number of applications.
- Hiring needs may fluctuate from year to year based on attrition and increases in staffing of sworn officers. Therefore, FicticiousPD may have varying short-term and long-term needs for digital media advertising.
- The digital media advertising shall consist of 30-second videos (produced by the FicticiousPD), carousel/flash ads, expandable ads, and static ads.
- Digital advertising should include, but is not limited to:
  1. Social media: 30-second videos and carousel ads
  2. Paid search engine marketing
  3. Behavioral and keyword targeting
  4. Retargeting ads on social media and search engine sites
- FicticiousPD wishes to refrain from having advertisements/videos displayed on video hosting sites, news media websites, and mobile sites.
- Once a digital media vendor is selected, the FicticiousPD requires a three (3) week turnaround for proofs of creative material for the initial campaign. All subsequent campaigns require a two (2) week turnaround time.

2.1 Scope of Services

- Utilize carousel ads or flash ads over static ads.
- Geo-fencing for a three (3) hour driving radius of Ficticia. The target audience is the Ficticia MSA and surrounding counties.

Other business certifications that do not specify majority woman or minority ownership may not be substituted.

The undersigned will enter into a formal agreement with the M/WBE Subcontractors/Proposers identified herein for work listed in this schedule, conditioned upon executing a contract with the Mayor and Aldermen of the City of Ficticia. The Prime’s subcontractor that subcontracts work must enter into a formal agreement with the tier subcontractor identified herein for work listed in this schedule. The Prime may count toward the goal any tier of M/WBE subcontractors and/or suppliers that will be utilized in the contract work. However, when an M/WBE subcontracts part of the work, the value of the subcontracted work may only be counted toward the goal if the tier subcontractor is an M/WBE. Any work an M/WBE firm subcontracts to a non-M/WBE firm will not count toward the M/WBE goal. It is the responsibility of the Prime contractor to advise all M/WBEs of this requirement and to ensure compliance by subcontractors.

Developing a Strong M/WBE Participation Plan
Key facts every bidder/proposer needs to know prior to developing their M/WBE Participation Plan:
1. All bidders/proposers must submit a “Proposed Schedule of M/WBE Participation” which identifies the minority and/or woman-owned companies that have agreed to participate in the project if awarded. All companies listed on the form must be certified as either minority-owned and controlled or woman-owned and controlled. The City does not accept a company’s “self-identification” as minority or woman-owned.
2. Proof of M/WBE certification from the certifying agency is required to accompany the bid; and certification must have been completed by the City of Ficticia, a federally-recognized or a state-level certifying agency (USDOT, State DOT, SBA 8(a) or GMSDC) utilizing certification standards comparable to the City of Ficticia.
3. The certification must have been approved prior to the due date of this bid. A firm that has submitted an application for certification but has not been certified will not be counted toward the M/WBE goal.
4. The M/WBE Office will be contacting all M/WBE firms included in the bidder’s M/WBE Plan to confirm each: a) was contacted by the bidder/proposer; b) performs the type of work listed; and c) agreed to participate.
5. To expedite the verification process, bidders/proposers need to: provide accurate phone numbers for all M/WBEs listed; ensure M/WBEs know to expect to be contacted by phone and email; request M/WBEs be accessible during the critical period before bid-opening; and advise M/WBEs that City staff must receive the M/WBE’s confirmation that the firm agreed to participate in the bid/proposal in order for the prime contractor to receive credit toward their proposed M/WBE participation goals.
6. If a proposed M/WBE cannot be confirmed as certified, performing the type of work described or agreeing to participate, the bidder/proposer will be notified and given a pre-determined period to submit a correction. If an M/WBE still cannot be confirmed or replaced, the proposed percentage of participation associated with the unverified M/WBE firm will not be counted and will be deducted from the overall proposed M/WBE goal.
7. Any tier of M/WBE subcontractors or suppliers that will be utilized in the contract work may count toward the MBE and WBE goal as long as the tier subcontractors/suppliers are certified M/WBEs. Work that an M/WBE subcontracts to a non-M/WBE firm does not count toward the M/WBE goal.
8. M/WBEs must perform a “commercially useful function” which is the provision of real and actual work or products, or performing a distinct element of work for which the business has the skills, qualifications and expertise, and the responsibility for the actual management and supervision of the work contracted.
9. Per the Proposed Schedule of M/WBE Participation “the undersigned (bidder/proposer) will enter into a formal agreement with the M/WBE Subcontractors/Proposers identified herein for work listed in this schedule, conditioned upon executing a contract with the Mayor and Aldermen of the City of Ficticia.” This signed commitment is taken seriously by the City, so do not list M/WBEs you do not plan to utilize. Any proposed changes must be pre-approved by the M/WBE Office, be based on legitimate business-related reasons, and still meet the M/WBE participation goals per the City’s contract.
10. A bidder who is a certified M/WBE may count toward the goal the portion of work or services on a City contract that is actually performed by the M/WBE, including: the cost of supplies/materials purchased or equipment leased for contract work, fees for bona fide services such as professional or technical services, or for providing bonds or insurance specifically required for the performance of a City contract.
11. If awarded the contract, the MWBE Office will be reviewing your company’s subcontracts, invoices and payment records to substantiate the completion of work and payment of M/WBEs. If the prime contractor is an M/WBE that is being included in its M/WBE goal, the prime contractor must maintain records that will be inspected to prove the portion of work performed, cost of work, and payments to the prime company.
12. Most bids for goods and materials do not have specific MWBE goals established for the contract. If no goals are included in the scope of work or General Specifications, you are not required to submit MWBE participation but are encouraged to do so when the opportunity is available. The City maintains this information for statistical purposes only and it is not reflected in the award decision.
